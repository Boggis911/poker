# poker
A poker game that allows the user to compete against bots. Created using C++ 

It was created as the final university C++ project. The program mimics the real-life poker game setting and offers advanced features that are unavailable in a live poker game.

The game allows the user to predefine the game parameters, such as number of bots, game difficulty and the starting chip count, which makes the program suitable for any user`s needs. The user can use the code to test or develop various poker strategies, since it is a risk-free environment and the user can play against up to 20 bot players without any additional time consumption when computer-controlled players make their turn. This gives an ultimate edge of practising when competing with a high number of players.  

The code uses some of C++ advanced functionality, including lambda functions, static variables and functions and many more. In addition, the game offers various insights to the player after every single game based on how well the player made decisions during the game and the outcome of the game, which can save a lot of time when trying to develop a poker strategy.
